## #OAKMTG Crew

We live tweet oakland meetings using the "#oakmtg" hashtag. Come join us!
We started out with and are actively engaged in "last mile" civic participation. We call in to Oakland
City Council and Oakland Policy Commission meetings during the public comment sections. This can and does
cause councilers and comissioners to change the what is being voted on.

We want to do more.

This site was made for us to be more effective at "last mile" civic engagement, as well as enable more folks
to join. There's a LOT to take in, so we made this website to make it easier to keep track of what's going on.
