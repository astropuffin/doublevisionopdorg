# TL;DR: A utility tax for unincorporated parts of Alameda County that has nothing to do with Oakland.

[Measure V](https://acgovt-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rovonedrive_acgovt_onmicrosoft_com/Documents/Measure%20Materials%20-%20November%203,%202020%20Election/01%20-%20Measure%20V%20-%20County%20of%20Alameda%20Utility%20Tax%20Extention%20Ordinance.pdf?CT=1602225258284&OR=ItemsView) would renew a tax on utility bills in unincorporated parts of Alameda County, but everyone in the county is [required to vote](https://www.kalw.org/post/alameda-county-measure-v-renewing-unincorporated-areas-utility-tax#stream/0) on them.

### What happens if Measure V passes?

Households in unincorporated areas of Ashland, Castro Valley, Cherryland, Fairview, San Lorenzo and Sunol will continue to pay a 6.5% tax on their utility bills. 

### Potential problems with Measure V

Honestly we don't really know. You can read more about it [here](https://www.kalw.org/post/alameda-county-measure-v-renewing-unincorporated-areas-utility-tax#stream/0). The only people opposing it are the same weird anti-tax people who oppose every county-wide ballot measure by writing "Are you kidding me?!" so it seems fine.

### Vibes

**Vote yes we guess?** Honestly this has nothing to do with Oakland, but it seems like it needs 50% of the county's vote to pass.
