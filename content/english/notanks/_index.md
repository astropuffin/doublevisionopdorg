Hello neighbor!

![](/images/notanks.jpg)

Did you know Oakland has a small tank, called a Bearcat?

Did you know Oakland Police used it as a shooting platform to murder a sleeping man?

The ensuing federal oversight included requiring a policy governing its (and other armored vehicles') use.

On January 11, the (all-volunteer) Police Commission's Ad Hoc committee held a public forum, where they heard unanimously from the public that **no one wanted the OPD to have a Bearcat at all**. Some public speakers shared very personal experiences, including one teenager whose family experienced a raid featuring the Bearcat (the raid was over supposed weed).

Despite the unanimous outpouring from all across the city calling for a decommission of OPD's tank, the Ad Hoc committee will be recommending at Thursday evening's Police Commission meeting to adopt a policy that allows broad continued use of the Bearcat.
