Hello neighbor!

Did you know Oakland has a small tank, called a Bearcat?

Did you know Oakland Police used it as a shooting platform to murder a sleeping man?

The ensuing federal oversight included requiring a policy governing its (and other armored vehicles') use.

On January 11, the (all-volunteer) Police Commission's Ad Hoc committee held a public forum, where they heard unanimously from the public that **no one wanted the OPD to have a Bearcat at all**. Some public speakers shared very personal experiences, including one teenager whose family experienced a raid featuring the Bearcat (the raid was over supposed weed).

Despite the unanimous outpouring from all across the city calling for a decommission of OPD's tank, the Ad Hoc committee will be recommending at Thursday evening's Police Commission meeting to adopt a policy that allows broad continued use of the Bearcat.

## Guide for public comment on Thursday at ~6:30PM

There's a closed session immediately before the public meeting, and it is possible that the closed session will run long. If you're signed in to this Zoom link with your hand raised by 6:30 pm, you should be able to comment for **one minute**: <https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88596700643>

Here are some tips for making a public comment:

* A minute is very short; practice before you speak.
* When it's your turn, unmute yourself. Identify yourself by name and include your district if you'd like.
* A reminder: **Police Commissioners are all volunteers!** They spend so, so many hours on this work. It's okay to tell them they're wrong, just try to remember that they're volunteers.
* Example: "Hi I'm \[name] and I live in District 1. I'm calling to comment on the armored vehicle use policy, because I think there aren't enough restrictions placed on the BearCat."
* After introducing yourself, you have about 45 seconds remaining. **Use your time wisely**. Tell a story. Tie it to yourself, and to your lived experience. Maybe that lived experience was a sinister encounter at a protest. Maybe it was hearing how kids are traumatized by the OPD tank. Tell your story.
* Use your "call a manager" voice. Express emotion, but don't take it out on the manager. You want them to be sympathetic to your plight.

And that's it! Congrats on making your first public comment!

## Why we're mad (YMMV)

At the #OakMtg (Appreciation) Club, we're mainly focused on transparency and accountability in local government, and we don't always take a specific stand on an issue besides advocating for better formal processes. This Armored Vehicle Policy makes us really mad because we think it's an example of how an institution like the Police Commission, whose purpose is to represent the public and oversee OPD, can f
