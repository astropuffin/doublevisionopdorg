# TL;DR: The legally-blind incumbent devoted to public transit, racial justice, and reforming the BART police

### Introduction

Lateefah Simon came to transit policy from a [racial justice](https://akonadi.org/our-team/lateefah-simon-president/) framework: she ran for her first term after BART officer Johannes Mehserle killed Oscar Grant. She is the president of an [Oakland nonprofit](https://akonadi.org/about/mission-values/) focused on “ending the criminalization of Black youth and youth of color.” She is also on the Board of [Trustees](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/board-of-trustees/meet-the-board-of-trustees) for the Cal State University system and received a [MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/720/) grant for her work on the Young Women’s [Freedom Center](https://www.youngwomenfree.org/history/). She is [legally blind](https://www.bart.gov/about/bod/bodMembersDetail_07), “has never driven a car and depends on BART everyday to get to work and take her daughter to school.”

### Official Platform

Simon plans to prioritize “more transit service to accommodate people who don’t own [cars](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Policing-debates-could-shape-upcoming-BART-board-15483037.php)” and [points](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/theleaguesf/pages/223/attachments/original/1599025024/BART-Lateefah-Simon.pdf?1599025024) to her record working to make BART more affordable: “I’ve worked towards discounted fares for those who need it, huge success that occurred in partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. BART will begin offering a 20% discount to low-income riders.”

### Stance on Policing

Simon seems to see BART police as a body capable of reform. She was pleased by the agency naming long-time officer Ed Alvarez BART's police chief back in January of this year, [saying](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BART-names-new-police-chief-14965209.php), “I do believe he’s open to creating a vision of safety ... for everyone, regardless of their economic status.” (The same article observed that “As the only African American board director, \[Simon] constantly fields texts or tweets when riders accuse BART police of racial bias.”)

Simon hopes to transform [BART police](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Policing-debates-could-shape-upcoming-BART-board-15483037.php), replacing armed officers with more “unarmed safety staff, including new teams of ambassadors to patrol the trains.”
