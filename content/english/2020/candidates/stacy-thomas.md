# TL;DR: A bookkeeper who’s heavy on her commitment to fight charter school expansion and clean up our budget but light on specifics

### Introduction

[Stacy Thomas](https://stacythomasfordistrict1.nationbuilder.com/about) is an accountant who’s lived in Oakland for 20 years. She works with [Action 2020](https://www.action2020oakland.org/), a group dedicated to supporting Oakland public schools. She’s also participated in a restorative justice program for students called the [McCullum Youth Court](https://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit/dc091009a6c04986a4deb751d71d543c-mccullum-youth-court-oakland).

### Official Platform

[Stacy Thomas’s](https://stacythomasfordistrict1.nationbuilder.com/) official [platform](https://stacythomasfordistrict1.nationbuilder.com/) focuses on three main areas: 1) the fact that she thinks there are too many charter schools run by “wealthy people outside our community;” 2) how her expertise as a bookkeeper could help manage OUSD’s financials; and 3) the need to fight back against the [state control](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/17/what-do-oakland-school-board-members-do-exactly/) of Oakland’s public schools.

Thomas [believes](https://mailchi.mp/a78f647d4514/d1-candidate-stacy-thomas-collecting-signatures-august-8-and-9) public schools “are the foundation of a democratic and economically just society.” She also--perhaps in reference to an episode where Boardmember [Jumoke Hinton-Hodge](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/03/02/video-shows-school-board-members-hand-on-throat-of-teacher-at-picket-line/) choked a teacher or to law enforcement body-slamming protesting teachers and parents at an OUSD Board [meeting](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/30/parents-teachers-sue-oakland-school-district-over-violent-board-meeting/) (who can say)--says she wants to reduce violence during OUSD Board meetings.

### Vibes

**Main vibes:** Great goals but short on specifics. We love Stacy Thomas’s enthusiasm and her philosophy, but on her website, the [“Solutions” page](https://stacythomasfordistrict1.nationbuilder.com/solutions) is pretty light on specifics.

**Needs an accessibility check vibes:** We were sad to discover that most of Thomas’s content was embedded in [image files](https://stacythomasfordistrict1.nationbuilder.com/) rather than text! This makes her website inaccessible to people who use screen readers or who have a hard time reading black text on a purple background.

There will be a candidate [forum](https://my.lwv.org/california/oakland/candidate-forums-info-november-2020) for this race on Thursday, October 8 at 6 PM.
