## Candidates

There are eight (8!!) candidates running for AD18 Assemblymember. This is a powerful, state-level position that typically only comes up for grabs every 12 years -- so anyone with any political ambition or interest will run when the opportunity arises!



#### [Malia Vella](https://maliavella.com/) (Alameda)
- Alameda City Council member
- [More endorsements than any other candidate](https://maliavella.com/endorsements/)
- Very odd endorsement list mix: Jovanka Beckles _and_ Don Perata?


#### [Janani Ramachandran](https://jananiforca.com/) (Oakland)
- The only Oakland candidate
- Also apparently the only candidate to [file her campaign finance information](https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Candidates/list.aspx?electNav=173)??
- Endorsed by Oakland politics legend [Gene Hazzard](http://www.cleanoakland.com/genes-blog), someone admired here at the #oakmtg (Appreciation) Club

#### [Mia Bonta](http://www.miabonta.com/) (Alameda)
- Name recognition: married to recently-resigned AD18 Assemblymember and newly-installed CA Attorney General Rob Bonta. What will this mean for legislators she doesn’t like? we only know enough to ask, not enough to speculate!
- Alameda Unified School District Board president
- CEO of the controversial Oakland Promise
- [Has a campaign page with no bio, no platform, no endorsements - but many ways to donate](https://miabonta.com/)

#### [Victor Aguilar](https://victorforca.com/) (San Leandro)

#### Stephen Slauson
- Token Republican on the ballot
- Ran in previous 2018 and 2020 AD18 elections

#### [Joel Britton](http://themilitant.com/)
- No party preference [according to SOS](https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/special-elections/2021-ad18/legislative-501-report.pdf) but lists http://themilitant.com/ as his website on [https://www.acgov.org/rov_app/candidatelist?electionid=243](https://www.acgov.org/rov_app/candidatelist?electionid=243)
- Out of all candidates, [has not accepted the voluntary expenditure limit](https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/special-elections/2021-ad18/legislative-501-report.pdf)
