### TL;DR: A frustrating but effective progressive who’s not always there when you call but always on time.


#### Introduction
Steph Dominguez Walton is currently unemployed but previously worked as a mortgage banker and in finance for national journalism corporations, according to her LinkedIn.  She’s an alumna of Emerge California, an intensive program that trains women Democratic candidates to run for office. She previously campaigned for Assemblyperson Buffy Wicks in 2018, but she has no experience as an elected official or in Oakland City Hall.

#### Background
Her two children attended Ecole Bilingue, an expensive ($30K per kid per year!) private school in Berkeley (although she lists volunteering at Oakland’s Piedmont Avenue Elementary School as her main example of community outreach). Her husband, Zachary Walton, is a lawyer who specializes in environmental law and sits on the Town Business Leadership Council. For more context on Zachary Walton’s business interests, see Jaime Omar Yassin’s reporting on District 1 campaign donors. 

#### Official platform
Walton’s official platform is virtually indistinguishable from incumbent Dan Kalb’s.
On her website, she says she is “committed to focusing on affordable housing and homelessness; equity in education; improving and reforming public safety; and supporting small businesses.” She also says she’s committed to answering calls from constituents, legislating transparently, and listening with empathy, but lists no other policy commitments. 

#### Stance on policing
Steph Dominguez Walton has repeatedly suggested that hiring more women police officers will stop police violence. At a candidate forum where she was asked what reimagining public safety means to her, Walton said, “I’d like to take some of these funds away from calls police re really not equipped to answer, like mental health calls, homeless complaints, some domestic violence calls” and put the money toward jobs for people who are experts at handling those issues (see this video starting around 42:00). 

#### Stance on the Howard Terminal A’s Stadium
Steph Dominguez Walton is publicly in favor of developing a new A’s Stadium at Howard Terminal. For more on her husband’s connections to this project, please see Jaime Omar Yassin’s reporting on District 1 campaign donors.  

#### Notable Supporters
- Assemblyperson Buffy Wicks, a former Obama staffer who was endorsed by Barack Obama and Kamala Harris
- Julián Castro, former Democratic Presidential Candidate
- Alameda City Councilmember Malia Vella
- Roseann Torres, Oakland School Board Member, District 5
- Phong La, Alameda County Assessor

#### Notable Campaign Donors
- **Real estate interests.** According to reporter Omar Yassin, one-fifth of Walton’s war chest comes from real estate interests,
Four board members from the East Bay Rental Housing Association, which opposes tenant protection in Oakland.
- **Non-Oakland based construction unions**. Yassin reports that PACs from UA Local 342, Sprinkler Fitters Local 483, Sheet Metal Workers 104, Northern California Carpenters, and Construction & General Laborers 304 all gave to Walton. 
- **People who have an interest in developing Oakland** (just not necessarily affordably). 


#### Vibes
**Main vibe**: Tracy Flick in Election (1999), but with fewer policy positions.

**Well-organized vibes**: Steph Dominguez Walton declared her candidacy more than a year before the November 2020 election, and this District 1 resident (Megan) first noticed flyers for her in the upscale Cole Coffee on College Ave back when it was still cold outside (so maybe January?). The pro-Walton buzz on District 1 Nextdoor is all about how she is likely to be a better Councilmember than current CM Dan Kalb because she is “tireless” and responds quickly to emails (Kalb is notoriously tough to get a response from).

**Very rich vibes**: This District 1 resident (Megan) noticed that her signature “Steph4Oakland” signs appear with even more frequency the higher up one happens to be in District 1’s affluent Oakland hills. During a candidate forum, Walton repeatedly said she’s “comfortable in all neighborhoods in District 1,” a mystifyingly rich-person comment to make since D1’s North Oakland is wealthy and safe even in its flattest parts compared to other Oakland districts. 

**Problematic girlboss feminism vibes**: On her official Twitter account, Steph Dominguez Walton frequently tweets about the importance of women supporting women, women running for office, and women shutting down racist and misogynistic remarks in public. The flipside of these otherwise positive tweets is that they play into an essentialized view of women as inherently more qualified to lead than men. While Steph seems well-intentioned, this District 1 resident (Megan) thinks beliefs like these often shield women politicians from being held accountable for their specific policy positions.

**Not super trustworthy vibes**: Steph Dominguez Walton definitely says all the right progressive things, but a few things make us think she’s not being very honest. Walton tried to take credit for Dan Kalb’s Clifton Hall deal during the August 18 Candidate Forum (see 1:06:00). Walton says she’ll bring “unity” to the Council, but it’s a strange thing to run on, because Kalb is (frustratingly) not a divisive member of the council; it makes us think she means eliminating Kalb’s (meager) opposition to the so-called equity caucus. Finally, her finance reports are remarkable because of how many people don’t actually list their occupations, which makes us wary of her. At a campaign house party, this D1 resident (Megan) gently pressed her to describe her own children’s experience with public schools after she spent 10 minutes explaining her volunteer work, and Walton answered by saying that “our neighborhood school was Chabot” without admitting her kids didn’t go there. Regardless of what she says, we think she’s running to the right of Kalb and likely to obstruct any truly progressive policies that come up before the council.
