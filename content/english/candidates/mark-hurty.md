# TL;DR: Pro-charter Teach for America alum focused on student literacy above all

*Full disclosure: the Oakland.Vote Ballot Guide volunteer who signed Hurty’s ballot qualification papers was not involved in the creation of this writeup.*

### Introduction

[Mark Hurty](https://markforoakland.com/) grew up in Oakland and graduated from [Skyline](https://markforoakland.com/who-is-mark/) High School in 1975. He is a Senior Project Manager at Education SuperHighway, a nonprofit focused on upgrading the Internet access in every public school classroom in America. He worked as a Special Education Teacher for three years in OUSD as part of Teach for America and then went on to serve as a Director at Teach for America.

### Official Platform: Stealth switch from public to charter schools

[Mark Hurty](https://markforoakland.com/) is focused almost exclusively on making sure OUSD students can read at grade level. He’s a firm believer in the restorative justice programs he’s worked with, and prefers “site safety” staff over police: people who’ve built relationships and can facilitate constructive responses rather than reactive police action. He is a member of GO Public Schools, a pro-charter organization funded by [Michael Bloomberg](https://twitter.com/DarwinBondGraha/status/1309313995308806146). He’s focused on closing the digital divide, wants to bring more decorum and listening to the board, and has studied a bit of education finance. He does not mention charter schools at all on his official campaign website.

### Vibes

**Main vibes: Probably going to approve more charter schools.** Here at the #oakmtg (Appreciation) Club, we basically understand charter schools as a way to privatize education with public money all in the name of outcomes. If you think that’s a good idea, Hurty is your man.

**Didn’t manage to take any photos with kids of color before the pandemic:** Like many of the stealth charter-school proponents in the OUSD Board races, Hurty’s website is full of [extremely](https://markforoakland.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mark-Hurty-25-2-scaled-e1601343546178-768x447.jpg) [funny](https://markforoakland.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/D10AA8D0-D987-492C-BAA7-F48B104E7682-768x615.jpeg) [photos](https://markforoakland.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7C288440-3096-4AAD-A6D5-61B7FF02EEF1-768x614.jpeg) of him taking socially-distant photos with kids of color. It’s good that Hurty valued everyone’s safety during these photo shoots, but the fact that he didn’t have any candid photos with any non-white community members makes us wonder how segregated his life in D3 is.
