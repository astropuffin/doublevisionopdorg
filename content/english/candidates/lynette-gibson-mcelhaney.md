### Introduction

Lynette McElhaney (pronounced “MAC-el-haney”) is the incumbent in the District 3 City Council race. She was first elected to City Council in 2012 and is serving her second four year term. She served as Council President (elected by her fellow Councilmembers) January 2015 - January 2017, and was both preceded and succeeded by Councilmember Larry Reid (D7) as President (he nominated her for Council President in 2015). Her council president term ended soon after the [Oakland Public Ethics Commission](https://oakland.granicus.com/DocumentViewer.php?file=oakland_be9f020021eef1ff6d2b053df81acd05.pdf) took Councilmember McElhaney to court for using her office for [personal](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/06/22/scathing-grand-jury-report-finds-oakland-city-council-president-mcelhaney-broke-ethics-rules/) [gains](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-ethics-commission-sues-City-Council-10421492.php).

McElhaney is originally from San Diego and lives in West Oakland with her husband, Clarence. Her son, Victor, was a student at USC when he was shot and killed in a robbery in 2019. She had previously lost a 17-year-old she considered her adopted grandson in 2015 when he was fatally shot in a robbery in West Oakland. Before serving on the Oakland City Council, McElhaney worked in the nonprofit sector, in housing, at Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services.
