# TL;DR: A shady business owner backed by Lyft who’s weirdly anti-government for someone running for government

### Introduction

Johnson grew up with his mother in Acorn housing in Oakland. He is a graduate of Fisk University, a historically Black college. He runs a somewhat-successful restaurant, Home of Chicken and Waffles, in Oakland (see next section for details). He formerly ran a few troubled, non-Oakland branches of the same restaurant. Johnson cites homelessness, city inefficiencies, and tenant protection ordinances that he thinks disadvantage landlords as deciding factors that led to him running for office. He believes that the At-Large seat should be held by someone who has [“a business mind.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaKNwXy5x8) He is very happy to have received an endorsement from his cousin, Kamala Harris.

### Official platform

Unlike other candidates, Derreck Johnson does not have a page devoted to “issues” or “priorities” on his official [campaign website](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/). Instead, Johnson has scattered his policy ideas throughout pages devoted to his [business background](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/about), his COVID-19 [relief plan](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/recovery_plan), and his [identity](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) as a Black gay man who grew up in Oakland’s Acorn housing projects.

Officially, Johnson seems to be hoping his business background telegraphs fiscal responsibility and good management skills; however, Johnson’s legal troubles cast doubt on his business bona fides. We think it’s pretty cool that Chicken and Waffles employees are [up to 70%](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/about) [formerly incarcerated](https://jailstojobs.org/home-of-chicken-waffles-derreck-johnson-creates-recipe-for-success/) people. But the business has some major issues despite that bit of awesome. Under Johnson’s management, the non-Oakland branches of Home of Chicken and Waffles in Daly City and Walnut Creek both closed. An [investigative piece](https://www.patreon.com/posts/council-derreck-40595481) written by Jaime Omar Yassin found that Johnson’s business, The Oakland Food Company, failed to pay his worker’s compensation insurance premiums for the Daly City branch from 2015 to 2017. Johnson was ordered by the court to pay State Farm $21,000; after 30 days of non-payment, the court ordered the seizure of Johnson’s company’s assets.

Johnson’s failure to pay his worker’s comp premiums seem to be part of a larger ambivalence toward paying people for their work. He is quoted in [a story](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) on small business grants from the Oakland African American Chamber of Commerce as saying that although he received a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan, he didn’t spend any of it because the regulations attached to it would “put me out of business.” Because [PPP money](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/expert-advice-on-how-small-businesses-should-use-ppp-loans.html) will only be forgiven if 75% of it is spent on employee paychecks (rather than on other overhead costs like rent), Johnson is essentially admitting to laying off [“90% of his staff”](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) rather than paying them with free government money.

On housing and homelessness, Johnson’s official platform mostly sticks to describing the problem and promising to “[use data](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/recovery_plan)...not politics, to decide which interventions to fund.” In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaKNwXy5x8) with Zennie Abraham, Johnson said he thinks development is the answer to the housing problem “because it's supply and demand.” [Johnson claims](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) to want “to increase housing security and strengthen renter protections and anti-predatory lending legislation beyond the current economic downturn,” but he has received [significant funding](https://www.patreon.com/posts/at-large-council-40894063) from executives of the East Bay Rental Housing Association, one of the organizations that regularly mobilizes against strengthening tenant protection ordinances. In an interview with [the Oaklandside](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/25/theres-one-at-large-seat-on-oaklands-city-council-three-very-different-candidates-are-running-for-it/), Johnson confirmed his anti-tenant stance when he implied that tenants have too many rights in Oakland and that these are harming smaller landlords. Rather than create stronger local tenant protections, Johnson would want the city to defer to the state’s tenant protections. Pamela Drake reports that in an interview with Block by Block Organizing Network, Johnson “[objected](https://draketalkoakland.com/2020/08/27/1126/) to the newest legislation to protect tenants from harassment.”

On Johnson’s [official website](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) he offers a “Blueprint for the Future of Oakland’s Black Community.” . Its focus on having a conversation (rather than enacting change) and giving Black individuals opportunities to work or start businesses (rather than directly giving resources to the Black community) make it seem like a less concrete, watered-down version of the Black New Deal candidates like [Carroll Fife](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/carroll-fife/) (D3), [Zoe Lopez-Meraz](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/zoe-lopez-meraz/) (D5), and [Richard Raya](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/richard-santos-raya/) (D5) are including as part of their platforms.

### Stance on policing

Johnson has consistently said that he believes policing needs to be reformed but that he thinks defunding police is the [wrong direction](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/How-the-debate-about-police-reform-could-remake-15447760.php). In his Sept. 8 [interview](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/How-the-debate-about-police-reform-could-remake-15447760.php) with Zennie Abraham, Johnson said, “I've been talking to people in the flatlands. African-American women don't want police dismantled. They want reform.” Johnson says he supports [8 Can’t Wait](https://8cantwait.org/), a campaign focused on changing specific police policies to reduce killings by police.
