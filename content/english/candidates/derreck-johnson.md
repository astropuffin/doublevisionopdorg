This page is under construction while we investigate [the Oaklandside's story](https://oaklandside.org/2020/10/07/after-a-messy-bankruptcy-oakland-city-council-candidate-derreck-johnson-lost-ownership-of-his-restaurant/) that Johnson hasn't owned Home of Chicken and Waffles since 2017. 

You can read our original write-up for Johnson below, but please note that much of the research in it is no longer accurate given that Johnson's been lying about his connection to Home of Chicken in Waffles. For example, it means that Johnson did **not** own a business during COVID-19 and thus could **neither** have received a PPP loan from the government or laid off 90% of his staff, as he told [ABC 7 News](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) in May 2020. 

# TL;DR: A Lyft-backed business owner who laid off 90% of his employees during COVID-19 despite getting a PPP loan

### Introduction

Johnson grew up with his mother in Acorn housing in Oakland. He is a graduate of Fisk University, a historically Black college. He runs a somewhat-successful restaurant, Home of Chicken and Waffles, in Oakland (see next section for details). He formerly ran a few troubled, non-Oakland branches of the same restaurant. Johnson cites homelessness, city inefficiencies, and tenant protection ordinances that he thinks disadvantage landlords as deciding factors that led to him running for office. He believes that the At-Large seat should be held by someone who has [“a business mind.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaKNwXy5x8) He is very happy to have received an endorsement from his cousin, Kamala Harris.

### Official platform

Unlike other candidates, Derreck Johnson does not have a page devoted to “issues” or “priorities” on his official [campaign website](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/). Instead, Johnson has scattered his policy ideas throughout pages devoted to his [business background](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/about), his COVID-19 [relief plan](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/recovery_plan), and his [identity](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) as a Black gay man who grew up in Oakland’s Acorn housing projects.

Officially, Johnson seems to be hoping his business background telegraphs fiscal responsibility and good management skills; however, Johnson’s legal troubles cast doubt on his business bona fides. We think it’s pretty cool that Chicken and Waffles employees are [up to 70%](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/about) [formerly incarcerated](https://jailstojobs.org/home-of-chicken-waffles-derreck-johnson-creates-recipe-for-success/) people. But the business has some major issues despite that bit of awesome. Under Johnson’s management, the non-Oakland branches of Home of Chicken and Waffles in Daly City and Walnut Creek both closed. An [investigative piece](https://www.patreon.com/posts/council-derreck-40595481) written by Jaime Omar Yassin found that Johnson’s business, The Oakland Food Company, failed to pay his worker’s compensation insurance premiums for the Daly City branch from 2015 to 2017. Johnson was ordered by the court to pay State Farm $21,000; after 30 days of non-payment, the court ordered the seizure of Johnson’s company’s assets.

Johnson’s failure to pay his worker’s comp premiums seem to be part of a larger ambivalence toward paying people for their work. He is quoted in [a story](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) on small business grants from the Oakland African American Chamber of Commerce as saying that although he received a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan, he didn’t spend any of it because the regulations attached to it would “put me out of business.” Because [PPP money](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/expert-advice-on-how-small-businesses-should-use-ppp-loans.html) will only be forgiven if 75% of it is spent on employee paychecks (rather than on other overhead costs like rent), Johnson is essentially admitting to laying off [“90% of his staff”](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) rather than paying them with free government money.

On housing and homelessness, Johnson’s official platform mostly sticks to describing the problem and promising to “[use data](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/recovery_plan)...not politics, to decide which interventions to fund.” In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaKNwXy5x8) with Zennie Abraham, Johnson said he thinks development is the answer to the housing problem “because it's supply and demand.” [Johnson claims](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) to want “to increase housing security and strengthen renter protections and anti-predatory lending legislation beyond the current economic downturn,” but he has received [significant funding](https://www.patreon.com/posts/at-large-council-40894063) from executives of the East Bay Rental Housing Association, one of the organizations that regularly mobilizes against strengthening tenant protection ordinances. In an interview with [the Oaklandside](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/25/theres-one-at-large-seat-on-oaklands-city-council-three-very-different-candidates-are-running-for-it/), Johnson confirmed his anti-tenant stance when he implied that tenants have too many rights in Oakland and that these are harming smaller landlords. Rather than create stronger local tenant protections, Johnson would want the city to defer to the state’s tenant protections. Pamela Drake reports that in an interview with Block by Block Organizing Network, Johnson “[objected](https://draketalkoakland.com/2020/08/27/1126/) to the newest legislation to protect tenants from harassment.”

On Johnson’s [official website](https://www.johnsonforoakland.com/blueprint) he offers a “Blueprint for the Future of Oakland’s Black Community". Its focus on having a conversation (rather than enacting change) and giving Black individuals opportunities to work or start businesses (rather than directly giving resources to the Black community) make it seem like a less concrete, watered-down version of the Black New Deal candidates like [Carroll Fife](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/carroll-fife/) (D3), [Zoe Lopez-Meraz](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/zoe-lopez-meraz/) (D5), and [Richard Raya](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/richard-santos-raya/) (D5) are including as part of their platforms.

### Stance on policing

Johnson has consistently said that he believes policing needs to be reformed but that he thinks defunding police is the [wrong direction](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/How-the-debate-about-police-reform-could-remake-15447760.php). In his Sept. 8 [interview](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/How-the-debate-about-police-reform-could-remake-15447760.php) with Zennie Abraham, Johnson said, “I've been talking to people in the flatlands. African-American women don't want police dismantled. They want reform.” Johnson says he supports [8 Can’t Wait](https://8cantwait.org/), a campaign focused on changing specific police policies to reduce killings by police.

### Stance on the Howard Terminal A’s Stadium

In a [questionnaire](https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Johnson-Oakland-City-Council-candidate-questionnaire.pdf) from the Oaklandside, Derreck Johnson refrained from taking a stance, instead listing his concerns with various aspects of the project. He is concerned 1) that there is a stalemate between the A’s and the City; 2) that the A’s are using Howard Terminal “as leverage, to force the City into selling them the property” (unclear if the property here is Howard Terminal or the Coliseum); and 3) that it would negatively impact port workers.

### Notable supporters

* Senator Kamala Harris (they’re cousins)
* Mayor Libby Schaaf (legendary h8r of incumbent Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan)
* Assemblymember Buffy Wicks
* Betty Yee, California State Controller
* Lateefah Simon, BART Board President
* Malia Cohen, State Board of Equalization Chair
* Don Perata, State Senate President Pro Tem (generally a law-and-order politician)
* Ignacio De La Fuente, Council President (ret.)
* Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley (a noted supporter of notorious Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern)
* Former Councilmembers Abel Guillen, Annie Campbell Washington, and Pat Kernighan

### Notable campaign donors

A few YIMBY activists [started a PAC](https://www.patreon.com/posts/shape-shifting-42014068) to support Derreck Johnson’s campaign, and was later joined by Lyft, the ride-sharing app, which contributed $100K to the PAC

### Vibes

**Main vibes: Libby, Lyft and landlords’ number one guy.** Fellow At-Large challenger Nancy Sidebotham expressed a widespread theory that Mayor Libby Schaaf tapped Derreck Johnson to replace her longtime rival, incumbent [Rebecca Kaplan](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/rebecca-kaplan/), when she told [the Oaklandside](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/25/theres-one-at-large-seat-on-oaklands-city-council-three-very-different-candidates-are-running-for-it/) that she thinks he’s “being run because he’s controllable.” All we can say for certain is that Johnson definitely isn’t running because he has a passion for policy. [Multiple stories](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/fundraising-wake-up-call/Content?oid=30368055%0Ahttps://ebcitizen.com/2020/08/10/gift-that-could-keep-giving-kamala-harris-endorses-oakland-at-large-candidate-derrick-johnson/) on Johnson have focused more on the endorsements he has received than on any policy positions he espouses. The fact that YIMBYs and Lyft would find [common](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/24/lyft-backing-campaign-to-unseat-oakland-councilmember-rebecca-kaplan/) [ground](https://www.patreon.com/posts/shape-shifting-42014068) in Derreck Johnson’s candidacy suggests that his appeal is based less on his novel civic ideas and more on his abilities to follow orders so as not to gum up the works the next time the Council is staring down a Mayor-initiated development project. Also, claims that Johnson's business background make him a good candidate to keep the [budget in line](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/01/editorial-these-five-could-steer-oakland-away-from-financial-cliff/) are belied by Johnson's own track record of abandoning his own struggling franchises; if elected, we can only keep our fingers crossed that Johnson's powerful City backers won't let him disappear from City Hall the same way.

**Not taking any of this too seriously vibes:** Although he did appear at the August 18 [East Bay Young Democrats Candidates Forum](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=773987683352218&ref=watch_permalink) and the August 19 [Alameda County Democratic Party Candidates Forum](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1266703727012996&ref=watch_permalink), Derreck Johnson missed the August 20 [Wellstone Club for Democratic Renewal Club’s Candidates Forum](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=298842841421549) allegedly to [appear](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1296288073735495681) [virtually](https://twitter.com/hyphy_republic/status/1296619266477678592) with his cousin, Senator Kamala Harris, at the Democratic National Convention (we couldn’t track down the footage).

**Bad boss vibes:** We really hate to see a boss who won’t pay [worker’s comp premiums](https://www.patreon.com/posts/council-derreck-40595481) (it’s the law!!!) or use a PPP loan to [pay his workers](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/) (“paycheck” is literally in the name!!!) and yet runs on how generous he is to employ up to 70% formerly incarcerated people (Johnson himself has never claimed to employ "over 70%" formerly incarcerated people, despite the claims of [some editorial boards](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/01/editorial-these-five-could-steer-oakland-away-from-financial-cliff/)). While Oakland’s rich and powerful have come out of the woodwork to endorse Johnson, we think it’s telling that his current and former employees either have remained silent or else aren’t valued enough to have their endorsements get top billing.

**A case of the giggles vibes:** Derreck Johnson has a tendency to stutter and laugh nervously when speaking publicly. Johnson has done ok during Zoom candidate forums because he can read from the screen without anyone really noticing (see this video, [starting around 19:05](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1266703727012996&ref=watch_permalink) or [this interview](https://abc7news.com/small-businesses-business-grant-african-american/6201659/)) but as soon as he runs out of prepared, written remarks, he’s back to giggling uncomfortably. This is fine (and charming!) for a private citizen, but it’s not the best habit for a City Councilmember who regularly has to speak in front of constituents (or with fellow Councilmembers!), and if the Council ever gets back in the habit of meeting in person Johnson is going to have a hell of a time speaking over heckling community members.

**Hates renters vibes:** While Derreck Johnson’s origin story is inspiring, we worry that his experience of pulling himself up by his bootstraps makes him unsympathetic to people who didn’t manage to work-and-luck their way into home ownership. We find it telling that he’d fill out a questionnaire for the Oaklandside stating he [supports tenant’s rights](https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Johnson-Oakland-City-Council-candidate-questionnaire.pdf) but then turn around in an interview with the same publication and say the city has [harmed landlords](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/25/theres-one-at-large-seat-on-oaklands-city-council-three-very-different-candidates-are-running-for-it/) by protecting tenants. Johnson generally keeps his positions vague, but we think you can count on him to stand by and let a big wave of pandemic evictions happen on his watch so that landlords can lose money because of vacancies and their own failed business acumen rather than because existing tenants can’t pay the rent.
