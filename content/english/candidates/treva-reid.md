## TL;DR: De facto incumbent who says all the right things (but omits a whole lot more)

### Introduction

In the only Council Member race without an incumbent, Treva Reid is the frontrunner and has received the most endorsements from current elected officials. Reid’s father is outgoing D7 Councilmember Larry Reid, and this is her second time filing papers to run for his seat. In 2015, she began [collecting campaign contributions for a 2016 run but then suspended her efforts](https://ebcitizen.com/2016/08/09/oaklands-larry-reid-files-for-re-election-to-city-council-as-daughter-awaits-turn/) after he decided not to retire after all. Like D1 candidate Steph Walton \[link], she’s an alumna of [Emerge California](https://ca.emergeamerica.org/emerge-california/what-we-do/), an intensive program that trains women Democratic candidates to run for office. Reid has worked in community and education groups and says she will focus on ending violence, affordable housing, closing the wealth gap. [She has also worked as a lobbyist for PG&E](https://ebcitizen.com/2019/11/14/believe-him-this-time-larry-reid-is-retiring-from-the-oakland-city-council/). She is on the board for Satellite Affordable Housing Associates.
