# TL;DR: A candidate running an analog campaign who probably will not win but has our favorite candidate candids

### Introduction

Taylor is not seen as a serious candidate in the D3 race.  She has very little online presence, and instead distributes flyers in person. This profile was updated on 9/12/20 to reflect an additional [Oaklandside article](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/11/district-3-council-candidates-differ-on-housing-police-and-the-meaning-of-progressive/) published that features Taylor. 

### Background

Taylor is listed as a “Longshoreman” on the [City of Oakland 2020 Election Qualified Candidates](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/2020-Election-Ballot-Order-w-Ballot-Designations.pdf) list. Taylor did not file with a party preference.  She is on the advisory board of the [West Oakland Senior Center](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/west-oakland-senior-center). The Oaklandside article speculates that Taylor may be the only candidate in the race that grew up in West Oakland; as discussed in another candidate profile, there is virtually no information available about [Alexus D. Taylor](https://oakmtg.club/candidates/alexus-d-taylor/), a mysterious competitor in this race. She may have the support of fellow dockworkers and union members, particularly with respect to her thoughts on Howard Terminal.

### Stance on policing

Unknown

### Stance on housing

Taylor says her main fight is against inaction in the neighborhood by city officials. She first saw the extraordinary power the sheriff has to carry out evictions when withnessing the Moms 4 Housing protest led by her opponent Caroll Fife

Taylor lives on the Magnolia Street block where the Moms 4 Housing protest took place. She said the demonstrations both “disturbed the neighborhood” and showed her the extraordinary power the sheriff has to carry out evictions.

“They had tanks on my block, and uniforms. I said, whoa, what is this, a war?” Taylor said.

The district has changed tremendously since Taylor was a child in West Oakland.

“The apartments being built, we can’t afford to live in them,” she said. She supports a policy like the proposed [Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act](https://oakclt.org/why-tenants-should-be-given-the-first-opportunity-to-purchase-their-buildings/), which would give renters the first shot at buying their building when it’s sold.

“Then I think it should go to \[the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], to try to keep it in the community,” she said, referring to publicly-owned housing.

Taylor is also a proponent of greater renter protections. She said she’s met many longtime Black renters during her council campaign this year who’ve experienced landlord harassment and discrimination because of their race.

### Vibes

**Main vibe:** Super-fun

There may be no candidate website, but that doesn't mean there's *zero* web presence!  Check out Taylor's Facebook page for some campaign candids.  We sincerely think her first selfie is very sweet (and way better than any of *our* first selfies!).  Also, Taylor is unafraid to climb aboard over a thousand pounds of horse to take a campaign photo.
