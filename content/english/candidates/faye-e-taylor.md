# TL;DR: A candidate running an analog campaign who probably will not win but has our favorite candidate candids

### Introduction

Taylor is not seen as a serious candidate in the D3 race.  She has very little online presence, and instead distributes flyers in person. This profile was updated on 9/12/20 to reflect an additional [Oaklandside article](https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/11/district-3-council-candidates-differ-on-housing-police-and-the-meaning-of-progressive/) published that features Taylor. 

### Background

Taylor is listed as a “Longshoreman” on the [City of Oakland 2020 Election Qualified Candidates](https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/2020-Election-Ballot-Order-w-Ballot-Designations.pdf) list as of 8/19/2020. Taylor did not file with a party preference.  She is on the advisory board of the [West Oakland Senior Center](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/west-oakland-senior-center). The Oaklandside article speculates that Taylor may be the only candidate in the race that grew up in West Oakland; as discussed in another candidate profile, there is virtually no information available about [Alexus D. Taylor](https://oakmtg.club/candidates/alexus-d-taylor/), a mysterious competitor in this race. She may have the support of fellow dockworkers and union members, particularly with respect to her thoughts on Howard Terminal.

### Official platform

Taylor's main fight is against inaction by city officials.

### Vibes

**Main vibe:** Super-fun

There may be no candidate website, but that doesn't mean there's *zero* web presence!  Check out Taylor's Facebook page for some campaign candids.  We sincerely think her first selfie is very sweet (and way better than any of *our* first selfies!).  Also, Taylor is unafraid to climb aboard over a thousand pounds of horse to take a campaign photo.
