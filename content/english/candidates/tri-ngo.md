#### Introduction
Tri Ngo is a long-shot candidate in the District 1 City Council race. He has a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from John Hopkins University and works part-time at a solar company. He’s a former Tesla engineer who also campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2008. To achieve his goal of a populist campaign, he’s purposely limited contributions to no more than $35 per person. To qualify for public funding from the City, he needs to raise $7,650 from Oakland residents, which means a little more than 218 of D1’s 57,000 residents would have to donate to him. As of right now (8/29) he’s raised ~$3,100, which means less than 1% of D1’s 57,000 residents have contributed to his campaign.

#### Background
According to Tri Ngo’s official website, Ngo’s parents were refugees from South Vietnam, and Tri was born in a refugee camp in Southeast Asia. He grew up in Philadelphia and Atlanta before attending the Massachusetts Institute for Technology. Ngo’s brother has cerebral palsy, which is why he originally went into biomedical research.

#### Official platform
Tri Ngo’s official platform stands out from the other candidates’ because of its concrete (if overly ambitious) proposals.
- Implement Liquid Democracy to try to create an accountable government that represents everyone
- Obtain rights to all vacant land and empty buildings for affordable housing
- Consider Universal Basic Income

Ngo’s first priority is creating an accountable government that represents everyone, which he plans to do by implementing something called Liquid Democracy. In person, he told this District 1 resident (Megan) that he wanted to have every resident of D1 vote online before each City Council meeting on every vote he’d have to take that meeting. Given how hard it is to get people to turn out for normal voting, however, it doesn’t strike us as super realistic to implement. Also, it’s an abdication of the responsibility elected representatives take when they commit to do the work and understand why they vote the way they do on each issue themselves.  

Ngo’s second and third priorities are homelessness and developing affordable housing. On these issues, Ngo is “considering” Universal Basic Income and wants the city to “[ob]btain rights to all vacant land, empty buildings and warehouses to build affordable housing.” Please note that Mayor Schaff has already pledged to run a pilot program of UBI in Oakland and there are multiple stakeholders actively working on it. You can read more about his specific policy proposals here. 

#### Stance on policing
On his Twitter, Tri Ngo once promoted attendance at the June 23 Special Meeting of the Oakland City Council where the so-called Equity Caucus passed a surprise budget. Ngo’s calls linked to “Reinvestin.us,” a site devoted to helping people how to comment on public meetings in support of defunding the police; however, he has not to our knowledge made a specific statement about his strategy to decrease police violence. **If you have more information on his stance on policing, please contact us.**

#### Stance on the Howard Terminal A’s Stadium
To our knowledge, Tri Ngo has made no public statement about the proposed Howard Terminal Stadium. This District 1 resident (Megan) ran into him on the street and asked him about it, but he did not seem very informed about the location or specifics. **Did we miss something? Reach out.**

#### Notable Supporters
Unknown. Do you know of any? Reach out.

#### Notable Campaign Donors
Because Tri Ngo’s supporters are limited to giving $35, it is not possible to find out who his notable campaign donors are. 

#### Vibes
**Main vibe**: Nice guy but not ready for Prime Time.
