### Introduction

Bronché Taylor does not have a working website (<http://bronche4oakland.com/> is dead for us as of writing), and he also does not seem to be active on social media yet. In addition, he left several of the questions on [the Oaklandside’s](https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Taylor.pdf) questionnaire blank. At the [Action 2020 forum](https://youtu.be/kApwfUlIZ04?t=472), Taylor said, “I don’t consider myself a politician, rather a socially engaged artist!”



Taylor has done nonprofit work for Youth Uprising, Alternatives in Action, and the [Oakland Public Education Fund](https://www.oaklandedfund.org/team-member/bronche-taylor/), where he currently works. Taylor’s documented concern about funding for education dates back to when [he was a student](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2012/03/06/on-the-money-college-president-paid-to-stay-away-from-campus/) himself. He also helped start the Oakland Best Buy [Teen Tech Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6bGWLS50zg&feature=youtu.be).

### Official platform

In the Action 2020 [candidate forum](https://youtu.be/kApwfUlIZ04?t=472), he was enthusiastic about wanting community involvement (extra advisory committees) and talked a lot about centering care for students: to deal with safety, hunger, and keeping schools around for our kids. That said, Taylor barely touches on these issues in [his questionnaire](https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Taylor.pdf) for the Oaklandside, and we wonder how much of these policies are actually commitments as opposed to off-the-cuff comments. In [his interview](https://oaklandside.org/2020/10/01/district-7-school-board-candidates-on-listening-to-residents-school-closures-and-budget-transparency/?utm_source=Oaklandside+master+list&utm_campaign=e0645a40b9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_09_24_07_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8612bcc0f3-e0645a40b9-333423634) with the Oaklandside’s reporters, Taylor said he opposed Measure Y, was for charter schools because they give parents choice, and wants to engage more with the public.

### Vibes

**Main vibe: Not doing the homework.** While this person seems like a delight who we’re glad to see involved in the District as an educator and advocate, he is not ready for prime time. With no website, a [partially-filled questionnaire](https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Taylor.pdf), and a few forum appearances, Taylor barely seems to be running for the Board, and your vote is better spent on the other more serious candidates.
