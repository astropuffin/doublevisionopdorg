### TL;DR: A labor organizer with slick headshots but virtually no concrete platform

He is also the founder of Bottom’s Up Community Garden, it’s off-shoot Bottom’s Up Cafe and Oakhella, a consultancy which specializes in experience creation.

#### Vibes

**Main vibe: Union organizer who pressed submit before doing their homework**

While Seneca Scott’s 20 years organizing on behalf of labor unions shows he has some experience in politics, his campaign proposals are pretty vague, and it feels like his campaign has stalled out.
