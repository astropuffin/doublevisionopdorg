# TL;DR: A police-loving critic of City Hall running a deliberately doomed campaign whose views on the economy might be eugenicist-adjacent

### Introduction

Nancy Sidebotham has lived in Oakland since 1964. She went to Cal State Hayward and Merritt College. She is a tax preparer, longtime District 6 resident, and perennial candidate. Sidebotham has run for City office [at least 5 times](https://ballotpedia.org/Nancy_Sidebotham) before this (we think). Most recently, she ran for Mayor in 2018, for Council Member At-Large in 2016, and for Mayor in 2014. She also at some point ran for Council Member in D6. She is a longtime community policing advocate and a neighborhood watch member. A born critic, she has some tendency to derail when asked for specific details about how to solve the problems she observes.

### Official platform

Unlike other candidates, Nancy Sidebotham’s campaign begins from the premise that she will likely lose. Her slogan is “Please join me in bringing Oakland back to its people; Vote Me #2 if you've committed to a game player” (by “game player,” she means either incumbent [Rebecca Kaplan](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/rebecca-kaplan/) or challenger [Derreck Johnson](https://www.oakmtg.club/candidates/derreck-johnson/)). Sidebotham’s campaign isn’t running for something so much as it is running against the [“backroom players”](https://nancysidebotham.com/about.php) she believes to be running City Hall right now. Unsurprisingly, Sidebotham says [her top priority](https://nancysidebotham.com/surveys.php) is doing an outside fiscal and performance audit of the City of Oakland (the City Auditor is a separate, also elected position), removing Mayor Schaaf's Oakland Promise program, and ensuring that resources are spread evenly throughout Oakland’s seven districts.

On housing, Sidebotham tends to side with landlords and homeowners at the expense of tenants and unsheltered people. While running for mayor in 2014, [Sidebotham said](https://oaklandnorth.net/2014/05/21/mayoral-candidate-nancy-sidebotham/), “Oakland is the dumping ground for Alameda County for all public housing.” In a [2018 interview](https://oaklandnewsnow.com/nancy-sidebotham-2020-oakland-at-large-city-council-seat-race-interview/u-s-news/28/12/2019/36105/), Sidebotham said, “The homeless is a county issue. They've dumped on Oakland...A lot of \[homeless] people are not from Oakland, even though they put it out that they are. They come from other states, because we have the climate that people are able to \[survive] living out on the streets.” At the [August 18 Alameda County Democrats Oakland Candidates Forum](https://www.facebook.com/acdemocrats/videos/1266703727012996), Sidebotham cautioned that the City must not attempt to solve homelessness at the expense of landlords and property owners. Sidebotham [is no friend to Oakland tenants](https://oaklandnewsnow.com/come-to-oakland-city-council-to-oppose-tenants-opportunity-purchase-act-topa-nancy-sidebotham/u-s-news/03/03/2020/41378/) either, strongly opposing Councilmember Bas’ TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act) policy before the legislation was drafted. Sidebotham owns five properties.
