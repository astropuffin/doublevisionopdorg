# TL;DR: A police-loving critic of City Hall running a deliberately doomed campaign whose views on the economy might be eugenicist-adjacent

### Introduction

Nancy Sidebotham has lived in Oakland since 1964. She went to Cal State Hayward and Merritt College. She is a tax preparer, longtime District 6 resident, and perennial candidate. Sidebotham has run for City office [at least 5 times](https://ballotpedia.org/Nancy_Sidebotham) before this (we think). Most recently, she ran for Mayor in 2018, for Council Member At-Large in 2016, and for Mayor in 2014. She also at some point ran for Council Member in D6. She is a longtime community policing advocate and a neighborhood watch member. A born critic, she has some tendency to derail when asked for specific details about how to solve the problems she observes.
