## The Procrastinator’s Guide to Oakland Voting

#### By #oakmtg friends

### **What this is:**

An in-depth look at the candidates running for office and measures on the ballot on November 3, 2020. Our goal is to present as many facts as we can about the folks running and the policies they are trying to push so you can easily digest it, make your own choices, and vote. There are no fully comprehensive, accessible voting guides in Oakland, so we wanted to make one for you.

### **Who we are:**

Your friends and neighbors across Oakland who came together after the murder of George Floyd to try to make changes in policing at the city level. We met after listening in to hours upon hours of Oakland government meetings and live-tweeting under #oakmtg. We rooted each other on as we tried to champion the #defundOPD movement alongside hundreds of community voices.

Then we became infuriated and fascinated by the lack of transparency and lies we saw so blatantly in front of us. We became hooked on understanding what was happening and why our city is so disorganized. We want to distill our ongoing work to understand our government into something that our friends and neighbors can understand. We especially want to uplift the voices of those in the Black community, which is the community most impacted by police violence and systemic racism. We may not even vote the same way amongst ourselves, and we think that’s okay, as long as we are all informed.
