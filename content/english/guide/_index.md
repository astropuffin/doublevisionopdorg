### **What this is:**

There are no fully comprehensive, accessible voting guides in Oakland, so we wanted to make one for you. We give you the facts and the research, you make your own choices, and vote on (or before!) November 3, 2020.

### **Who we are:**

We are your friends and neighbors across Oakland who came together after the murder of George Floyd to try to make changes in policing at the city level. We met after listening in to hours upon hours of Oakland government meetings and live-tweeting under #oakmtg. We rooted each other on as we tried to champion the #defundOPD movement alongside hundreds of community voices.

As we learned together, we saw the need in our city civic processes for more transparency and accountability. We became hooked on understanding what was happening and why our city is so disorganized. We want to distill our ongoing work to understand our government into something that our friends and neighbors can understand. We especially want to uplift the voices of those in the Black community, the community most impacted by police violence and systemic racism. We may not even vote the same way amongst ourselves, and we think that’s okay, as long as we are all informed and supporting each other in creating a better Oakland.
