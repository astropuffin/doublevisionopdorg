### **What this is:**

There are no fully comprehensive, accessible voting guides in Oakland, so we wanted to make one for you. We give you the facts and the research, you make your own choices, and vote on (or before!) November 3, 2020.

### **Who we are:**

We are your friends and neighbors across Oakland. For more information about us, check out our [About page](/about).

### **Figure out your district:**

If you don't know your district, you can figure it out here: [http://gisapps1.mapoakland.com/councildistricts/](http://gisapps1.mapoakland.com/councildistricts/ "http://gisapps1.mapoakland.com/councildistricts/")
