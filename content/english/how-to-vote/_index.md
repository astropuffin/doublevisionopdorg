### How do I vote?

As you already know, 2020 is a total mess. To pre-empt the difficulty of voting during a pandemic, we’ve outlined all the different ways and times you can vote below.

### By Mail:

All Californians who are registered to vote this year will receive ballots by mail, sent out by October 5th. Please note that as of this writing, Trump is defunding and dismantling the USPS, deprioritizing mail-in ballots-- so we encourage you to track your ballot using this tool: <https://california.ballottrax.net/>


### Dropping off your ballot:

Alameda County has set up 24-hour Ballot Drop Box sites. You can find your closest one [here.](https://www.acgov.org/rovapps/maps/ballotdropbox_map.htm)

They also have “Ballot Drop Stops,” which are drive-thru ballot drop-offs. (As of this writing, no Drop Stops have been set up yet.)

### In-Person:

There are NO neighborhood polling places this year, so you may need to travel further than you are used to! There are also fewer polling places than usual. Find a polling place on the [AC Vote website.](https://www.acgov.org/rov_app/pollinglist)

### What if I never get a ballot?

You will need to go to one of the polling places and tell them you need to vote provisionally because your ballot was lost in the mail. We anticipate this may happen to many voters. You should get a stub, which is essentially a receipt, from the ballot they give you to fill out--you can use that to look up when your ballot was counted.

### Here are important dates:

* **Sept. 4th:** Deadline to register to get a County and [State](https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/quick-reference-guide/) voter guide (these are super useful! We encourage you to register in time!)
* **Sept. 24th:** State and County voter guides will be mailed out to anyone registered before Sept. 4th
* **Oct. 5th:** Ballots mailed out
* **October 19th:** Deadline to register to vote

  * Super procrastinator? Us, too. If you miss that deadline, you can still register to vote conditionally with a provisional ballot the day-of-- it’s California law. You will need to find an in-person polling place. 
* **Oct 31st - Nov 3rd:** In-person voting! Check here for the list of polling places available: <https://www.acgov.org/rov_app/pollinglist>

### Voting Accessibility:

As with previous years, Alameda County allows curbside voting for those unable to enter the polling place, and as required by law offer accessible voting booths. For more info on accessible voting, check out the AC vote [website.](<https://www.acvote.org/accessibility.page>)
